# 3DPScheduling

## Description
The problem of service matching and scheduling in cloud manufacturing (CMfg) is complex for different types of manufacturing services. 3D printing, as a rapidly developing manufacturing technology, has become an important service form in the CMfg platform due to its characteristics of personalized manufacturing. How to solve the task scheduling problem for distributed 3D printing services in CMfg needs further research. In this paper, a service transaction model of 3D printing services in CMfg is built. Based on the service transaction model, we propose 3D printing service matching strategies and matching rules of different service attributes, including model size, printing material, printing preciseness, task cost, task time, and logistics. To reduce the delivery time of tasks from service suppliers to service demanders, a 3D printing service scheduling (3DPSS) method is proposed to generate optimal service scheduling solutions. In 3DPSS, optimization objective, constraints, and optimization algorithm are presented in detail. Experimental results show that the average task delivery time of 3DPSS is shorter than that of typical scheduling methods, such as particle swarm optimization, pattern search, and sequential quadratic programming, when the amounts of tasks change. This repository contains the source code of our published paper.
